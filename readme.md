DresGuardian — A Privacy First Telegram Group Management Bot with Built-in AI and DuckDuckGo Web Search

A powerful, fully self hosted Telegram bot that puts your privacy first. No logs, no tracking, no third-party data collection just pure encrypted functionality.

Forever Free • Open Source • Zero Compromises on Privacy

Built by DresOS — because your data belongs to you.

# What It Does

DresGuardian combines advanced group moderation with a privacy respecting AI assistant:

# AI & Private Search (Available to Everyone)
- `/ask <question>` — Chat with a powerful AI powered by Cerebras Llama 3.3-70B (no OpenAI, no data harvesting)
- `/search <query>` — Fully anonymized and encrypted web search via DuckDuckGo:
  - Your real IP is never sent — replaced with a fake static IP (`203.0.113.42`)
  - Custom headers: fake User-Agent, Do-Not-Track (`DNT: 1`), and spoofed forwarding IPs (`X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Real-IP`, `Client-IP`)
  - No cookies, no trackers, no referrers
  - All requests made over HTTPS with short timeouts
  - IP-related queries (e.g., "what is my IP") are automatically blocked to prevent accidental leaks
  - Results returned cleanly in HTML with safe links
- Mention the bot directly (e.g., `@YourBot`, "hey dres", "yo dres") — triggers AI response
- Built-in per-user rate limiting (1.5s cooldown) to prevent spam and abuse

# Full Group Moderation (Admin Only)
- Warn System: `/warn` → adds a warn. At 3 warns, user is automatically muted for 1 hour (warns reset after punishment)
- `/delwarn`, `/warns` — remove or check warns
- `/kick`, `/ban`, `/unban`
- `/mute 10m`, `/mute 2h`, `/mute 1d` — timed mutes with flexible duration
- `/unmute`
- Banned Words Filter: `/addword <phrase>` — any message containing the word/phrase is auto-deleted
- `/removeword` — remove from banned list

# Custom Welcome Messages (Admin Only)
- `/setwelcometext <message>` — supports placeholders:
  - `{first}` → user's first name
  - `{mention}` → clickable mention
  - `{username}` → @username or name if none
  - `{id}` → user ID
- `/setmedia` — reply to a photo, GIF, or video to set welcome media
- `/setchannellink <url>` — adds a "Join Channel" button
- `/clearwelcome` — remove welcome entirely
- Welcomes trigger on new members (supports both legacy and new chat member updates)

# Owner-Only Features
- `/blacklist` — globally blacklist a user from the bot
- `/unblacklist`, `/blacklisted` — manage and view the global blacklist

# Data Storage
- All settings (welcomes, banned words, warns, global blacklist) are stored locally in a single file: `dresguardian_store.json`
- No database required
- No cloud sync
- Easy to backup or migrate — just copy the JSON file
- Data is loaded on startup and saved automatically after changes
- File is written with proper encoding and indentation — human-readable if needed

# Privacy & Encryption Guarantees
- Zero logging of messages, queries, or user activity
- No analytics or external tracking
- Sensitive credentials (bot token, API keys) loaded securely from `.env` — never hardcoded
- AI requests go only to Cerebras (privacy-respecting provider) over encrypted connections
- Search requests are fully anonymized and protected as described above
- End-to-end handling: Messages processed in memory only — nothing persisted beyond configuration
- You control the server — full data sovereignty and encryption at rest (depends on your filesystem)
